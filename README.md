# zz-jason.github.io

https://zz-jason.github.io is my personal blog, it's a static site generated by hugo. This readme is more like a reminder to me to record how to set-up environment and write blogs.

- set up `hugo` environment:

use docker image `klakegg/hugo:0.80.0`, download the source code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zz-jason/zz-jason.github.io.git
```

- write blog:

```sh
cd zz-jason.github.io
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/src -p 1313:1313 klakegg/hugo:0.80.0 new posts/your-post-name.md
```

- publish the blog:

The github action would generate the site automatically, you just need to push your markdown file to the github.
